## Description
The goal of this project was to organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to uncover any hidden trends.

## Initial Insights
* Campaigns related to entertainment made up almost 69% of the Kickstarter projects. 
    * Film & Video – 12.6%
    * Games – 4.9%
    * Music – 17% 
    * Theater – 33.9%
* Kickstarters related to entertainment also accounted for more than 80% of all successful campaigns.
* Campaigns related to journalism were the smallest category represented (0.5%), and all such campaigns presented in the data were eventually canceled.
    * No other outcomes (failed, successful, or live) were recorded for journalism-related campaigns. 
* Kickstarter campaigns had a greater success rate in the first five months of the year. 
    * December was the lowest month for successful campaigns. 

## Limitations/Concerns 
* There is an inconsistent use of currency within the dataset. Even though multiple countries are represented in the data, converting all values to a single, standard currency would allow for more direct comparisons between campaigns. 
* The lack of any outcome other than “canceled” for campaigns categorized as journalism raises the concern the dataset may be incomplete.  

## Future Areas of Investigation 
* Review of the average length of a Kickstarter campaign by parent category and sub-category.
* For campaigns that exceeded their goal, what is the average overachievement (in funds/currency) by parent category and sub-category?
* Review the relationship between projects identified as “Staff Picks” vs. not, both as an aggregate of all projects and broken down by category. 

## Technologies Used
* Excel
